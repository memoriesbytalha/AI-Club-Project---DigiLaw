# AI-Club-Project---DigiLaw
This is a team collaboration effort, as we divided into sub teams to handle front end and backend. Through classic, PHP MyAdmin we utilized databases to imitate a chatbot behavior. This project can be taken as prequel to an actual project with an LLM trained specifically on a domain. 
This project has been made a reality through the combined efforts of:
https://github.com/1iqrashaheen   https://github.com/KashfKamal217  https://github.com/1iqrashaheen  https://github.com/Mujtaba0150 and me.

Moreover, I would like to extend gratitude to https://github.com/memoriesbytalha for his moral support during this project.
The demo video along with an exported database can be found among the files.
